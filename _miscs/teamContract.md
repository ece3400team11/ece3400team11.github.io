# TEAM CONTRACT

ECE 3400, Semester #FA18 Team # 11

Team Members: Daniel Weber, Adam Wojciechowski, Shivansh Gupta, Vignesh Nandakumar

## Team Procedures

1. Team meetings will be in Upson Hall 142 on Fridays from 11:15 - 12:05

2. Slack will be the primary mode of communication

3. Decisions will be made by consensus

4. We will rotate meeting roles every week based on who the team leader is that week. We will have a record keeper, agenda setter, and a meeting coordinator. The agenda will be written and disseminated over Slack the night before the team meeting

5. The record keeper will rotate every meeting. They will type the minutes during the meeting and disseminate them via Slack afterwards

## Team Expectations

### Work Quality:

1. Project standards (What is a realistic level of quality for team presentations, collaborative writing, individual research, preparation of drafts, peer reviews, etc.?):
  Information quality will be prioritized over visual quality for team meeting presentations. Every document uploaded to the website will be reviewed by every member of the team to ensure high quality. If a member chooses to do any individual research, their findings should be reported to the rest of the group if it could be of use to others. 

## Strategies to fulfill these standards:

### Team Participation:

1. Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks:
    - The team leader will be in charge of distributing tasks to the rest of the team
    - If there are any issues with team cooperation, the team leader will step in to resolve the conflict
2. Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members (team maintenance):
    - During meetings, we have brainstorming sessions. Every team member will be expected to provide at
      least one idea.
    - The member in charge of the minutes will document every idea mentioned to make sure all ideas are
      acknowledged.
    - If multiple ideas are presented for the same problem, the team will delegate and reach a consensus.
3. Strategies for keeping on task (task maintenance):
    - There will be milestones assigned for every task that have their own deadlines to help team members
      stay on target.
    - The team leader will be in charge of communicating with the rest of the team and making sure everyone
      is meeting their deadlines
4. Preferences for leadership (informal, formal, individual, shared):
    - The leadership roles will be individual, but not permanent. The roles will change after every major
      milestone in the project.

### Personal Accountability:

1. Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings:
    - Every member is expected to attend every team meeting. If a member is unable to attend, they must let the
      team know at least 24 hours before the meeting, barring extreme circumstances
    - Every member is expected to be punctual. Try to show up at least 5 minutes before the meeting starts. If a
      team member knows they will be late, let the rest of the team know at least an hour before the meeting.
2. Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:
    - Every team member should be primarily responsible for the tasks given to them. If someone needs additional
      help, they can ask other members.
    - Every team member will be responsible for meeting their deadlines. This is important because other team
      members may be dependent on the completion of your tasks.
3. Expected level of communication with other team members:
    - If a question is addressed to the entire team that requires everyone to answer, team members should try to
      answer within 4 hours.
    - When a task is completed, the team member in charge of that task should notify the rest of the team and, if
      applicable, make their work available to the rest of the team.
4. Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks:
    - If there is a decision that affects the entire team, everyone on the team should know about it and will
      be allowed to have a say.
    - Tasks will be evenly distributed between team members.
    - Every team member is expected to contribute 6-10 hours per week to the project. This will most likely go
      up near the end of the semester.
### Consequences for Failing to Follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations

1. Describe, as a group, you would handle infractions of any of the obligations of this team contract:
    - For the first infraction, the team member will receive a warning from the team leader. The team member
      in violation must acknowledge that they violated the team contract.
    - For the second infraction, the team member will be publicly shamed on the website.
2. Describe what your team will do if the infractions continue:
    - If infractions continue (member misses 3 meetings without excuse, fails to complete their tasks, etc.),
      the team member in violation will be removed from the website.

## Team Leadership

Every person on the team will have to take the role as a leader. The role of the leader will be to organize meetings and make sure that everything is submitted in a timely manner. Please note here who will be responsible when:
